## Extension Settings

With version `v0.0.3` we are introducing the ability to configure the back up interval and how many items thats kept in memory. We would ideally recommend to eep the `numberOfLocalHistoryItems` to something between 5-10 and the `backupInterval` to something around 600-900 seconds.

```
    "localhistory.backupInterval": {
        "default": "600"
    },
    "localhistory.numberOfLocalHistoryItems": {
        "default": "5"
    }
```
